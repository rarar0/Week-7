How to be a Software Engineer

I felt this slideshow covered the very basics and gave some good advice on 
how to make yourself desirable to hire. 

##The key points of this were:
Algorithimic analysis
Coding proficiency (in at least 1 language)
Python proficiency
Bash Proficiency
SQL Proficiency
Being able to install a server with a linux flavor of choice
Having a basic understanding of common security vulnerabilities
Finding productivity and not disturbing the productivity of those around you
Lastly, being able to build a resume that displays all these skills and pass the technical interview.

I feel that requiring all of these skills for an entry level position may be a bit much. As the 
presentation states, these skills take years to build (even longer to perfect). How long are you expected to work in internships
before you are even considered for a job with a fortune 500 company?

How often is big O actually considered when creating software/scripts/code? How will big O 
matter when quantum computing becomes the norm?
